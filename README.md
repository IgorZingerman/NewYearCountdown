# new-year-countdown

I saw this: https://github.com/coord-e/new-year-countdown/tree/master and i loved the idea. That repository has gone the way of the dodo, and is not supported. I figured I'd mess with this a bit. So, i spent a little bit of time and threw this together. 

# Install

```
% npm i
```

# Run
```
% npm run build;
% npm start
```

# What to modify

Eh, no notes here, but things are relatively straight forward. Everything is in the `src/index.js` file, I'll try and add notes. Maybe.
